<h1>Network Services Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

Explored the intricacies of network services such as SMB, Telnet, and FTP through hands-on exercises and practical demonstrations. This comprehensive walkthrough was designed to deepen understanding of these protocols, enhance penetration testing skills, and equip with the knowledge to secure network environments effectively.


<h2>Achievements:</h2>

- **Protocol Proficiency:** Gained insights into the functionalities and vulnerabilities of SMB, Telnet, SSH, and FTP protocols
- **Effective Enumeration:** Learned to conduct thorough port scanning using Nmap and enumerate services with Enum4Linux, acquiring valuable information for exploitation
- **Vulnerability Exploitations:** Explored and exploited weaknesses in network services to gain unauthorized access and retrieve flags, demonstrating the ability to identify and capitalize on security flaws
- **Tool Mastery:** Utilized a range of penetration testing tools including Hydra, Metasploit, and Netcat for efficient exploitation and post-exploitation activities

<h2>Skills Demonstrated: </h2>

- **Service Enumeration and Analysis:** Demonstrated proficiency in using Nmap and Metasploit for service enumeration and analysis, enabling the identification of potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- **Exploitation Techniques:** Developed skills in exploiting vulnerabilities associated with NFS, SMTP, and MySQL services, including privilege escalation, password cracking, and SUID file manipulation
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successfully escalated privileges on target systems by exploiting vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in NFS, SMTP, and MySQL services, showcasing the ability to gain unauthorized access to critical resources
- **Security Assessment:** Conducted comprehensive security assessments of network services, including NFS, SMTP, and MySQL, by identifying and mitigating security weaknesses and recommending remediation measures
